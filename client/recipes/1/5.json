  "intro": "Spice up your supper with fiery piri-piri chicken.",
  "ingredients": [
  "1 onion, roughly chopped
  "4 garlic cloves, chopped"
  "2 unwaxed lemons, juice and zest only"
  "generous dash Worcestershire sauce"
  "4 mild red chillies, seeds removed and chopped"
  "2 red birds’-eye chillies, seeds removed and chopped"
  "2 tbsp white wine vinegar"
  "1 tsp smoked paprika"
  "1 tsp dried oregano"
  "1 tsp soft light brown sugar"
  "1 tsp salt (optional)"
  "small bunch of parsley"
  "1 chicken, spatchcocked"
  "steps": [
    "Put all the ingredients, except the chicken, in a food processor and pulse until you have a smooth marinade.",
    "Put the chicken in a shallow dish and pour over the marinade. Massage the marinade into the chicken as much as you can, then cover and leave to marinade in the fridge for at least 3 hours or preferably overnight."   
    "When you are ready to cook the chicken, either prepare a barbecue or preheat your oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6."
    "To barbecue, put the spatchcocked chicken on the grill and cook for around 5 minutes on each side over the direct heat, then move to the side a little to finish off – it will probably take another 20 minutes of regular turning. Spray regularly with water (or beer) if it is browning too quickly. Alternatively, roast in the oven for 30–35 minutes, or until the juices run clear."
